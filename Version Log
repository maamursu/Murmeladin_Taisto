0.1: 
added class for maa:
      created ground

added class for Hahmo:
  ability to "jump", as in moving upwards when "W" is pressed (stays then there)

0.1.2
  created gravity for "beings" (turns off when jumping)
  added safetynet to height-15 to prevent falling off the world, stops all positive Y-axis movement
!jump probably makes every single "Hahmo" jump when "W" is pressed, fix it!
-> move functions under "jump()"
